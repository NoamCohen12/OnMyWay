# 🚐 OnMyWay – Ride Management & Parent Confirmation System  
**Full-Stack Web Application (MVP)**

**OnMyWay** is a full-stack web application designed to help a **ride escort / driver** manage child pickups efficiently and in the correct order.

Parents confirm whether their child will participate in the ride, and the escort receives a **clear, visual platform** showing:
- Which children need to be picked up
- Their pickup locations
- The correct pickup order for the ride

The system combines parent confirmation, geolocation, and interactive map visualization.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this system is to provide a **ride escort** with a reliable tool that answers two key questions:

1. **Which children should be picked up today?**
2. **In what order should they be collected?**

Parents only confirm participation, while the escort sees an aggregated and ordered route.

## 🗺️ Map & Visualization

The application uses **Leaflet** with **OpenStreetMap** tiles to visualize:

- Ride starting point (bus icon)
- Passenger pickup locations
- Color-coded markers:
  - 🟢 Green – Child is going
  - 🔴 Red – Child is not going
  - 🔵 Blue – Selected / highlighted passenger
- Ordered pickup route list synchronized with map markers

Passenger addresses are automatically geocoded using the **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API** when a new passenger is added.

## 🔌 Backend API Endpoints

- `GET /users` – Get all passengers (escort view)
- `GET /users/:id` – Get single child (parent view)
- `PUT /users/:id/status` – Update ride status
- `POST /addUser` – Add passenger
- `DELETE /deleteUser/:id` – Delete passenger
- `GET /route` – Get ordered ride route
